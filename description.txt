Calamity Schematic Exporter allows you to take screen selection captures and export them as schematics for consumption by Calamity's schematic manager.

Schematics can contain tiles and walls from any mod but do not save tile entities. Attempting to place a schematic which contains tiles from an unloaded mod will place TML Mystery Tiles. As TML does not have Mystery Walls, walls from unloaded mods will cease to exist.

This mod also adds a special tile and wall for use in schematics. The Schematic Preserver Tile/Wall will never be placed by the schematic manager and are used to mark positions where you would like the original tiles/walls to remain untouched.

Sprites for the Schematic Preserver Tile/Wall are taken from Example Mod.
